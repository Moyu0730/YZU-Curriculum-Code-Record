    "A":["Love Is a Bit Sour", "This year, your love is a little sour, but fortunately, it is not bitter. Sometimes, although it is sour, there is a hint of sweetness in it. Even if you are not destined to be together with the person you like, you can still bless each other. You feel a little sad in your heart because you are open-minded. Now I really don't care much about love. I won't force it, nor do I desire anything passionate or sweet. I just hope that after this period of bitterness, there will be sweetness."],
    "B":["Love Is Super Sweet", "This year, your love is super sweet, really as sweet as honey. If you show your love to others from time to time, it will make people around you feel sick. Of course, you are so lucky to meet sweet love because you are a warm person. You deserve such good love and deserve others to love you well. You will also cherish each other more and give back to each other well. This is the correct way to open love."],
    "C":["Love Has Its Bittersweet Moments", "Your love this year must have both bitterness and sweetness. In fact, this is a normal relationship, or an ordinary relationship. Some people are always sweet, they are lucky ones. But you are an ordinary person. There will be sweet moments in your relationship, but there will also be quarrels and conflicts, tears, and pain. But only if you learn to manage your relationship rationally, enjoy it when it is sweet, and examine it in time when it is bitter, can love last."],
    "D":["Love Is Bland and Tasteless", "This year, your love life will be dull. You may not meet love at all and will continue to be single for another whole year. This is also good because you can be busy making money. Maybe your love is just like a bowl of plain boiled water, without any taste, but you can't live without it. Or maybe it's because of a lack of excitement, but whose love can always be so passionate? Being as plain as water and flowing steadily may not be a bad thing."]
